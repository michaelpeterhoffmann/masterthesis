This repository contains a culmination of my master's thesis work, featuring seven distinct transformer models designed specifically for detecting hate speech in German, Italian, and Spanish social media posts. 
Each of the seven files also entails a SVM-classifier. If you use the code, please cite this repository and reference my master's thesis as follows:
•	Hoffmann, M.P. 2023. “Multilingual hate speech detection on social media: Applying transfer learning methods to classify german, italian and spanish posts”. Master’s thesis. Freie Universität Berlin. (8) 2023
The thesis will also be published in 2024, and you can use this reference:
