This repository contains a culmination of my master's thesis work, featuring seven distinct transformer models designed specifically for detecting hate speech in German, Italian, and Spanish social media posts. 
Each of the seven files also entails a SVM-classifier. If you use the code, please refer and cite this repository.  
If you have questions, feel free to reach out to me and drop me an email!
